# Google Meet Call Alerter  ðŸ’»

Tired of sitting through a boring meeting? But obliged to respond when called out? Worry not, you have the "Google Meet Call Alerter". It listens to the meetings on your behalf, and when it thinks that someone is calling your name out or trying to get attention, it alerts you!

So, you can sit back and relax, until someone calls you!

****Worried about Data Privacy?****
None of the data collected by this software leaves your computer. Whatever data is collected, it stays within the software and only for as long as the software is running. When the program restarts, all the previous data is lost. And on top of all that, this program does not use the internet for any other purpose apart from running the Google Meet meeting. Don't believe me? I have open sourced the code. See for yourself!
